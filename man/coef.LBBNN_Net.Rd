\title{Get model coefficients (local explanations) of an \code{LBBNN_Net} object}
\usage{
\method{coef}{LBBNN_Net}(
  object,
  dataset,
  inds = NULL,
  output_neuron = 1,
  num_data = 1,
  num_samples = 10,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{LBBNN_Net}.}

\item{dataset}{Either a \code{torch::dataloader} object, or a \code{torch::torch_tensor} object.
The former is assumed to be the same \code{torch::dataloader} used for training or testing.
The latter can be any user-defined data.}

\item{inds}{Optional integer vector of row indices in the dataset to compute explanations for.}

\item{output_neuron}{integer, which output neuron to explain (default = 1).}

\item{num_data}{integer, if no indices are chosen, the first \code{num_data} of \code{dataset} are automatically used for explanations.}

\item{num_samples}{integer, how many samples to use for model averaging when sampling the weights in the active paths.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
A data frame with rows corresponding to input variables and the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{lower}: lower bound of the 95\% confidence interval
\item \code{mean}: mean contribution of the variable
\item \code{upper}: upper bound of the 95\% confidence interval
}
}
\description{
Given an input sample x_1,... x_j (with j the number of variables), the local explanation is found by
considering active paths. If relu activation functions are assumed, each path is a piecewise
linear function, so the contribution for x_j is just the sum of the weights associated with the paths connecting x_j to the output.
The contributions are found by taking the gradient wrt x.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item If \code{num_data = 1}, confidence intervals are computed using model averaging over \code{num_samples} weight samples.
\item If \code{num_data > 1}, confidence intervals are computed across the mean explanations for each sample.
\item The output is a data frame with row names as input variables
(\code{x0}, \code{x1}, \code{x2}, ...) and columns giving mean and 95\% confidence intervals for each variable.

\donttest{
# Example (not run): compute local explanations for first 5 samples
# model <- train_LBBNN(...)
# coef(model, dataset, num_data = 5)
