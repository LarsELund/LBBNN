\title{Class to generate one RNVP transform layer.}
\usage{
RNVP_layer(hidden_sizes, device = "cpu")
}
\arguments{
\item{hidden_sizes}{A vector of ints. The first is the dimensionality of the vector,
to be transformed by RNVP. The subsequent are hidden dimensions in the MLP.}

\item{device}{The device to be used. Default is CPU.}
}
\description{
Affine half flow aka Real Non-Volume Preserving (x = z * exp(s) + t),
where a randomly selected half z1 of the dimensions in z are transformed as an
affine function of the other half z2, i.e. scaled by s(z2) and shifted by t(z2).

This implementation uses the numerically stable updates introduced by IAF:

\examples{
z <- torch::torch_rand(200)
layer <- RNVP_layer(c(200,50,100))
out <- layer(z)
print(dim(out))
print(layer$log_det())
}
